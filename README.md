# PhoneTester
DIY Project to create a device to replicate and exceed the capabilities of a BK 1045x phone product test device.


Device must privide the following tests:

Battery voltage
Ring voltage
On/Off Hook indication
Polarity reversal
TX audio test with visual audio level indicator
RX audio test with simulated dialtone 
DTMF digit decode and freq display for tuning *
Rotary Pulse decode as well as dial rate / make & break ratio **

* BK can only decode, it does not display detected frequencies.
** BK can only count pulses, speed and ratio readings are helpful for reconditioning and recalibration.
