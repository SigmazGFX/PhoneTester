# PhoneTester
DIY Project to create a device to replicate and exceed the capabilities of a BK 1045x phone product test device.


Device *must* provide the following tests:

1. Battery voltage
2. Ring voltage
3. On/Off Hook indication
4. Polarity reversal
5. TX audio test with visual audio level indicator
6. RX audio test with simulated dialtone 
7. DTMF digit decode and freq display for tuning *
8. Rotary Pulse decode as well as dial rate / make & break ratio **

* *BK can only decode, it does not display detected frequencies.
* **BK can only count pulses, speed and ratio readings are helpful for reconditioning and recalibration.
