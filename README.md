# PhoneTester
DIY Project to create a device to replicate and exceed the capabilities of a BK 1045x phone product test device.


Device *must* provide the following:

1. Ring voltage
2. Loop current (with this we get a free sidetone test, and power for device)
3. On/Off Hook indication
4. Polarity reversal
5. TX audio test with visual audio level indicator
6. RX audio test with simulated dialtone 
7. DTMF digit decode
8. Rotary Pulse decode with dial rate / make & break ratio **


* **BK can only count pulses, speed and ratio readings are helpful for reconditioning and recalibration.
